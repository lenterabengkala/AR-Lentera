# AR-Lentera
This Augmented Reality application was designed by the IEEE HAC Team in collaboration with the Udayana Community Development Program in an effort to help people with disabilities (deaf and dumb) and the general public who want to learn sign language, especially "KATA KOLOK" by representing the Bengkala village version of the sign language, Buleleng, Bali into an interactive 3D animation that appears by scanning a marker. This Augmented Reality application was created using Unity Engine and Vuforia software and is supported by Design Sketchup Software, Adobe Photoshop and compiled with the C# programming language.
